# Design-an-application-to-serve-public-health
## Context of this project:
The “Santé publique France” agency has launched a call for projects to find innovative ideas for applications related to food. You would like to participate and propose an application idea.
(datasets can be downloaded here: https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)

Your mission:

After reading the call for projects, here are the different steps that you have identified:

1) Process the dataset:

Thinking about an app idea.

Identifying variables relevant to future treatments, and necessary for your application idea.

Cleaning the data by:

highlighting possible missing values, with at least 3 processing methods adapted to the variables concerned;

identifying and quantifying possible outliers for each variable;

automating these treatments to avoid repeating these operations.

2) Throughout the analysis, produce visualizations to better understand the data. Perform a univariate analysis for each variable of interest, in order to summarize its behavior.

3) Confirm or refute the hypotheses using multivariate analysis. Perform appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results.

4) Justify your application idea. Identify arguments justifying the feasibility (or not) of the application based on Open Food Facts data.

5) Write an exploration report and pitch your idea during the project defense.
